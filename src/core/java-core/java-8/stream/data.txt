Tom tit, or mantis shrimp, is a dish that seafood lovers do not want to miss out on when visiting Ha Tien.
Since this creature usually breeds around the third and fourth lunar months,
the best time to try this food is six months before that when it carries a lot of ripe roe.
These eggs are considered a delicacy. Besides, tom tit caught during this season will have more fat and meat.

Mantis shrimp can be found in restaurants across Ha Tien cooked in various ways such as steamed with lemongrass,
roasted with garlic and cooked in a hot pot. A portion costs VND100,000-150,000 ($4.3-6.5).
