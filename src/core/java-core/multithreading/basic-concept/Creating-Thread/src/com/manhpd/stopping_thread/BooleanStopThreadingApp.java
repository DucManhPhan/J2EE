/**
 * There are two way to stop threading:
 * 1. Using flag boolean variable
 * 2. Using interrupt() method
 *
 * Actually, using interrupt() method is probably preferrable to using flag boolean variable.
 * The reason behind that if we're in an interruptable blocking call (like Thread.sleep or using java.nio Channel operations),
 * we'll actually be able to break out of those right away.
 *
 * If we use a flag, we have to wait for the blocking operation to finish and then we can check our flag.
 * In some cases, we have to do this anyway, such as using standard Inputstream / Outputstream which are not interruptable.
 *
 * In that case, when a thread is interrupted, it will not interrupt the IO, however, we can easily do this routinely in our code (
 * and we should do this at strategic points where we can safely stop and cleanup).
 *
 * if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
 * 		// cleanup and stop execution
 * 		// Ex: break in a loop
 * }
 *
 * The main advantage to Thread.interrupt() method is that we can immediately break out of interruptable calls,
 * which we can't do this with flag approach.
