 * https://scratchpad101.com/2011/08/22/concurrency-pattern-producer-consumer/
 *
 * Disadvantage:
 * - The continueProducing variable of Broker class is not volatile variable. So, when using multithreading, reading value of it is not correct.
 * - Use Future functionality will block our main thread --> reduce performance of system.
