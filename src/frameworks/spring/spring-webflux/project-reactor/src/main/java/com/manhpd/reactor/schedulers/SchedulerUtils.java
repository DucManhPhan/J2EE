/**
 * The publishOn() method influences the emitting process. It takes an emitted element from the upstream and
 * replays it downstream while executing the  callback on a worker from the associated Scheduler. This means it will also
 * affect where the subsequent operators will execute (until another publishOn() is chained in).
 *
 * The subscribeOn() rather influences the subscription process. It does not matter where it is put in the reactive
 * pipeline, it always affects the context of the source emission, and does not affect the behavior of subsequent calls to
 * publishOn() method. If there are multiple subscribeOn() method in the chain the earliest subscribeOn() call in the chain
 * is actually taken into account.

/**
 * Some static method of Schedulers class:
 * - Schedulers.immediate() - The current thread.
 *
 * - Schedulers.single() - A single, reusable thread. Note that this method reuses the same thread for all callers, until
 *                         the Scheduler is disposed. If we want a per-call delicated thread,
 *                         use Schedulers.newSingle() for each call.
 *
 * - Schedulers.newSingle() - Creates a new Thread each time it is called to be used by the underlying Flux.
 *
 * - Schedulers.elastic() - An elastic thread pool. It creates new worker pool as needed and reuses idle ones.
 *                          Worker pools that stay idle for too long (default is 60 seconds).
 *                          This is a good choice for I/O blocking work for instance.
 *                          Schedulers.elastic() is a handy way to give a blocking process its own thread, so that
 *                          it does not tie up other resources.
 *
 * - Schedulers.parallel() - A fixed pool of workers. It creates as many workers as you have CPU cores.
 *
 * - Schedulers.fromExecutor(Executor) - Creates a Scheduler to use the given Executor, allowing you to use your extensive
 *                                       knowledge of Java's Executors.
